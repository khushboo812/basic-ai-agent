## ü§ñ About The Project

This AI assistant listens for spoken commands through a microphone and responds with a synthesized voice. The primary goal was to learn the pipeline of a voice-based application:

* Capturing audio input from a microphone.
* Converting spoken language into text using a speech recognition engine.
* Processing the text to understand the user's intent.
* Generating and speaking a response using a text-to-speech engine.
