> **Note:** For a voice project, a short video or an animated GIF is the best way to show it off! You can use a free tool like Giphy Capture or ScreenToGif to record your screen while you interact with your agent. Create an `images` folder and save it as `demo.gif`.

## 🤖 About The Project

This AI assistant listens for spoken commands through a microphone and responds with a synthesized voice. The primary goal was to learn the pipeline of a voice-based application:

* Capturing audio input from a microphone.
* Converting spoken language into text using a speech recognition engine.
* Processing the text to understand the user's intent.
* Generating and speaking a response using a text-to-speech engine.

## ✨ Features

* **Voice-Activated:** Listens for and responds to spoken commands.
* **Real-time Interaction:** Engages in a basic, real-time conversation.
* **Recognizes key phrases** like "what is the time?", "what is your name?", etc.
* **Speaks responses aloud** instead of just printing them to the console.
